A portfolio website using HTML, CSS, and Java provides a professional and interactive platform to showcase personal projects, skills, and experiences. HTML structures the content, ensuring semantic and accessible web pages. CSS styles the website, offering aesthetic appeal and responsive design across devices. Java, via frameworks like Spring or Servlets, enhances interactivity and functionality by handling backend logic, server-side processing, and database interactions. This combination results in a dynamic, visually appealing, and user-friendly portfolio that effectively highlights an individual's accomplishments and capabilities.
